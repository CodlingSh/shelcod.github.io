        <p>Hello, welcome to my personal website. I just finished my first year of the Computer Programmer course at Lambton College and I am putting together this personal website as a way to apply some of the stuff I learnt in my web tech courses, some stuff I learnt on my own in the past, and some new stuff that I will learn along the way.</p>
        <br><p>As long as I can remember, computers have been a big part in my life. When I was 4 years old, my grandpa gave my family his old 486-based PC, but after many family upgrades, I finally bought my own laptop when I was in high school and since it was my own device, I was finally allowed to tinker with it. So I developed a deep understanding of Windows and played around with various Linux distrobutions. Despite building my own desktop PC a few years later and that laptop being fairly dated, I still have a soft spot for it due to how much I learned from it.</p>
        <br><p>In 2013, I took the Computer Network Specialist course at Lambton College, where I learnt about computer repair, system maintanence and using Windows Server 2008 to administer a network. Unfortunatley, I was not able to find any meaningful, full-time work after graduating from the course.</p>
        <br><p>In 2018, I discovered the Raspberry Pi, and after buying one and playing around with it, I discovered that I really enjoy programming. So after saving up some money, I decided to go back to school for computer programming. Unfortunatley, the Covid-19 pandemic happened right before I was supposed to start the course, So my classes have all been online. But despite the challenges of online learning, I still managed to achieve a 3.8 GPA.</p>
        <br><p>Besides computers, my other hobbies include video games, watching movies and biking.</p>
