        <p>Hello there, and welcome to my webpage.</p>

        <p>Since 2012, I have been an avid programmer. I stand at the front of the fastest moving technology trend in the world today- computer programming. Since I was four years old, I have always had a soft spot for computers. Memories of our family-owned 486-based PC are still fresh in my mind, as it gave me my first exposure to the world of computers. From those humble beginnings, I developed a deep understanding of several Linux distributions and Windows. Consequently, my love for programming has been growing ever since.</p>

        <p>My computer-relevant educational background dates back to 2013, where I took the computer network specialist course at Lambton College, where I studied system repair and computer maintenance. But currently, I am a second-year computer programming student. My formal training has laid a solid foundation that I hope to build on in my programming journey. I have gained an in-depth understanding of HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, Python, and SQL. Additionally, I have acquired self-taught skills in Lua, C, and Bash.</p>

        <p>For me, the sky is the limit, and I hope to live to embrace the core values of innovation and technology. When I’m not studying or coding, I enjoy playing video games, graphic design, programming, watching movies, mountain biking, chess, and toying around with Linux distributions. </p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to get to know me better. If you have any questions for me, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:shelcod@gmail.com">shelcod@gmail.com</a> or check out my <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to follow me on social media.</p>
